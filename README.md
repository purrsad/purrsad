<h1 align="center">Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm Prasad</h1>
<h3 align="center">A passionate UX Engineer and Full Stack Developer</h3>
<br />

<p>As a passionate software engineer with a Master's in Computer Science, I thrive on turning complex challenges into elegant solutions. My journey spans from building AR applications to revolutionizing community platforms, always with an eye on user experience and cutting-edge technologies. I've led teams, mentored juniors, and consistently delivered results that exceed expectations.</p>

<p>My toolkit is diverse: from JavaScript and Python to cloud technologies and DevOps practices. I'm equally comfortable refactoring legacy systems as I am architecting new applications from the ground up. My experience across different domains - from fin-tech to education - has honed my ability to adapt quickly and deliver value in any environment.</p>

<p>I'm driven by a desire to create impactful, scalable software that makes a difference. Whether it's optimizing performance, enhancing user interfaces, or streamlining processes, I approach each project with enthusiasm and a commitment to excellence. Let's connect and explore how we can build something amazing together!</p>

<p>I have also done several projects in deep learning and various full-stack projects utilising frameworks like React, Angular, Java and Spring.</p>
